I am an economist studying the economics and econometrics of human capital investments. My current research focuses on the effect of ambiguity and robust decision-making on investment decisions in dynamic life-cycle models. I hope to gain a better understanding of the observed investment patterns and the effectiveness of human capital policies.

## Research

Please see my [curriculum vitae](/cv/) for more details.

## Software

I develop my research software as part of the [Open Source Economics](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics) organization.
