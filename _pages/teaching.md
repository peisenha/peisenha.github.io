## OSE Scientific Computing

The sound analysis of computational economic models requires expertise in economics, statistics, numerical methods, and software engineering. We first provide an overview of basic numerical methods for optimization, numerical integration, approximation methods, and uncertainty quantification. We then deepen our understanding of each of these topics in the context of a dynamic model of human capital accumulation using [respy](https://respy.readthedocs.io). We conclude by showcasing basic software engineering practices such as the design of a collaborative and reproducible development workflow, automated testing, and high-performance computing.

## OSE Data Science

This course introduces students to basic microeconmetric methods. The objective is to learn how to make and evaluate causal claims. By the end of the course, students should be able to apply each of the methods discussed and critically evaluate research based on them. Throughout the course we will make heavy use of [Python](https://respy.readthedocs.io) and its [SciPy ecosystem](https://www.scipy.org) as well as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
