typography, responsive breakpoints, content principles).

## Project overview

Static personal website for Philipp Eisenhauer, hosted via GitHub Pages at
peisenha.github.io. Three-page site covering professional profile, operating
principles, and technical memos. Deployed to GitHub Pages via a deploy workflow.

## Development setup

No build step. Open any `.html` file under `site/` in a browser to preview. Deploy happens
automatically on push to main via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (publishes `site/` directory).

## Common commands

- `python -m http.server -d site` — serve locally at localhost:8000 for preview
- `git push origin main` — deploy to GitHub Pages (triggers CI)

## Architecture

- `site/` — deployable website directory (published to GitHub Pages)
  - `index.html` — profile page: header, positioning, showcase, experience, publications, teaching, education
  - `operating-principles.html` — operating principles: foundation, iteration (Learn/Decide/Repeat), leverage
  - `memos.html` — memos index: links to individual memo pages
  - `memos/validation.html` — memo: Validation Strategy (placeholder)
  - `styles.css` — shared stylesheet across all pages
  - `assets/` — images and SVG assets (`{page}-{subject}.{ext}` naming)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — GitHub Pages deployment workflow

## Verification

1. Open each HTML page under `site/` in a browser and verify navigation links work
2. Verify all external links open correctly (LinkedIn, GitHub, publications)
3. Check mobile responsiveness at 768px and 480px breakpoints
4. Push to GitHub and confirm deploy workflow passes

## Key conventions

- Pure static HTML/CSS — no build tools, no frameworks, no JavaScript
- All pages share the same nav (Profile / Principles / Memos), font stack, and `styles.css`
- Google Analytics — gtag snippet (G-00JS1JND0F) included in every page's `<head>`
- Active nav link uses `aria-current="page"`

## Cross-page structure (MUST maintain symmetry)

### Navigation

`Profile` / `Principles` / `Memos` — consistent across all pages.

### Page structure

All pages follow the same skeleton:

1. `<nav>` — sticky gradient bar with three links
2. `<div class="content">` → `<header>` (title + optional subtitle/epigraph) → `<main>`
3. `<header>` has bottom border with 120px accent gradient overlay

### Section headings

| Page | Sections |
|------|----------|
| Profile (index.html) | Science × Engineering × Decision / Showcase / Experience / Publications / Teaching / Education |
| Principles | Foundation / Iteration / Leverage |
| Memos | (card list, no h2 sections) |

### Showcase cards (index.html)

Three cards with badge labels matching the positioning formula:

- **Science** — Structural Models for Policy-Making
- **Engineering** — Impact Engine
- **Decision** — Inside Amazon's AI Factory
