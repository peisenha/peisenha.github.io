I develop my research software as part of the Open Source Economics initiative.

## [Open Source Economics](http://open-econ.org)

We provide a platform for economists, mathematicians, and computational scientists to facilitate the transdisciplinary collaboration in the development, analysis, and application of computational economic models. Together, we expand the set of possible economic questions that we can address and improve the quality of our answers. We provide numerous software libraries that we use in our research. We also host several events to facilitate the exchange of ideas among contributors.
