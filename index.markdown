I am an economist by choice and a transdisciplinary researcher by necessity. My research focuses on dynamic models of human capital accumulation as differences in human capital attainment constitute a significant determinant of inequality in various life outcomes such as labor market success and educational attainment across and within countries. I shed new light on the underlying economic mechanisms by combining innovative economic modeling with access to unique datasets and advanced computational methods.

See my website and [curriculum vitae](https://github.com/peisenha/peisenha.github.io/blob/master/assets/eisenhauer-cv.pdf) for more details.

## Software

I develop my research software as part of the [Open Source Economics](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics) organization.
